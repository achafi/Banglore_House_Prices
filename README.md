# Banglore_House_Prices
End to end machine learning project  to predict house prices

In this project, I first build a model using sklearn and linear regression using banglore home prices dataset from Kaggle. Second step is to save the trained model and deployed on Flask server, so this server can use the model to respind http requests. Third component is to build an web page in html, css and javascript that allows user to enter home square ft area, bedrooms etc and it will call python flask server to retrieve the predicted price. 
During this project i covers almost all data science concepts such as data loading and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tunning, k fold cross validation etc.
<br>
Technology and tools used for this project covers :
1. Python
2. Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
3. Matplotlib for data visualization
4. Sklearn for model building
5. Jupyter notebook, visual studio code as IDE
6. Python flask for http server
7. HTML/CSS/Javascript for UI
